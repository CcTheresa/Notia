Instead of avoiding, denying, or struggling with your inner emotions, you can learn to accept that these deeper feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations and should not prevent you from moving forward. We as a culture are dedicated to the idea that negative emotions need to be fixed or managed, but ACT shows that acceptance, mindfulness, and values are key psychological tools for transformation. Suppression of difficult feelings ultimately leads to more distress. As Brianna Wiest writes, the mountain is you—your greatest obstacles are internal, and healing begins when you stop running from what you feel and start moving through it."

Allow the emotion to exist without judging it or yourself. Notice that you can feel something painful and still function.

When you're fused with a thought like 'I'm a failure,' you believe it completely. When you defuse, you see it as 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure'—which creates space between you and the thought. Techniques include singing the thought in a silly voice, labeling it ('There's that failure story again'), or visualizing it on a leaf floating down a stream. This doesn't eliminate the thought; it reduces its power over you. As Brianna Wiest emphasizes, your thoughts create your reality—learning to observe them without being controlled by them is essential for emotional freedom."

These negative core beliefs—often formed in childhood—create cognitive distortions that maintain feelings of worthlessness. CBT research shows that challenging and reframing these thoughts can significantly improve self-esteem and reduce depression. To truly heal, you need to change the way you think and become very conscious of negative and false beliefs, then start shifting to a mindset that actually serves you. Just because your brain thinks something doesn't mean it's true."

When you worry, not only do you lose energy, but you also unconsciously seek out situations that confirm your fears.

Rather than targeting the content of worry, effective interventions target the worry behavior itself by promoting nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness. This creates psychological distance from negative thoughts. Interestingly, worry often intensifies when everything's going right, not wrong—it's your mind's alarm system checking if it's safe to get attached to something new."

We are not wired to be happy; we are wired to be comfortable, and anything outside our comfort zone feels threatening until we become familiar with it. This is why positive life changes—new jobs, healthy relationships, success—can trigger anxiety or depressive episodes. Your mind is experiencing adjustment shock and hypervigilance, checking for threats in unfamiliar territory. This doesn't mean the change is wrong—it means your nervous system needs time to recalibrate."

Understanding where your self-doubt comes from is pivotal because it enables you to address these feelings more effectively.

Catastrophic thinking thrives when you fuse with the thoughts—when you believe 'I am a failure' instead of recognizing 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure.' Cognitive defusion techniques create psychological distance from catastrophic thoughts. You can label them, give them names, even sing them in silly voices to drain their emotional power. This doesn't eliminate the thoughts, but it reduces their intensity and control over your emotions and behavior. Building awareness through mindfulness practice helps you recognize catastrophic thinking patterns as they arise."

When you let yourself thoughtfully consider your coping strategies, the catastrophe becomes less terrifying because you realize you're not as powerless as your anxiety suggests. This technique, called decatastrophizing, involves asking: 'How bad would it really be? Would it really be something I couldn't recover from?' A future problem can be significantly unpleasant without amounting to a disaster. Envisioning yourself coping—reflecting on resources, strengths, and support you've used before—builds resilience and confidence."

For example, a friend doesn't text back right away, so you assume they're angry at you, which leads you to withdraw socially, lash out, ruminate, or behave in non-productive ways. Using CBT, you can recognize your tendency to jump to worst-case social conclusions. The next time this happens, remind yourself of the evidence: your friend has always returned texts before and is likely just busy. Such reframing helps you refrain from engaging in counterproductive behavior and prevents relationship damage based on imagined catastrophes."
